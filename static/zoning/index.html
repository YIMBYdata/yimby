      <h1>zoning map</h1>
      <p>
        san francisco makes it uniquely hard to build housing. most of the city is zoned to
        disallow dense, walkable developments.
      </p>
      <p>
        the most beautiful and iconic buildings are often in violation of current zoning, meaning
        they couldn't be built today.
      </p>
      <p>
        even if you buy land (very expensive) and have a plan to build something that complies fully
        with all zoning restrictions and height limits and other laws, that doesn't mean you can do
        it.
      <p>
      <p>
        the Discretionary Review process means that such developments can still be blocked by
        neighbors, by the Planning Commission, by the Board of Supervisors. if a new building passes
        all that, it can still be blocked by CEQA, the "California Environmental Quality Act",
        which allows construction opponents to block projects in ways that have nothing to do with
        the environment. ironically, environmentalist goals like building public transit are often
        blocked by CEQA, keeping people spread out and in cars. projects are often delayed for
        years, and while they are, you pay property tax (some of the highest in the country) on an
        empty lot.
      </p>
      <h2>RH-1: the burbs</h2>
      <p>
        most of the residential land in our city is suburban-style development where you're only
        allowed to build a single unit per lot. RH-1(D) means those units have to be detached
        houses.
      </p>
      <h2>RH-2 and -3: low density residential</h2>
      <p>
        better than RH-1, but still pretty sparse, and still typically car-centered.
      </p>
      <h2>RM: residential mixed</h2>
      <p>
        these zones allow housing, grocery stores, office space, and shops in the same neighborhood.
        much friendlier for people who want to walk or bike.
      </p>
      <h2>NCT and NCD: "neighborhood commercial"</h2>
      <p>
        these are mixed districts that allow housing, shops, and transit. they vary in density, but
        some are pretty great.
      </p>
      <h2>C: commercial</h2>
      <p>
        this mostly means office towers, but also includes shopping malls. unfortunately in SF, most
        commercial development has no convenient transit. people are expected to drive.
      </p>
      <h2>M and PDR: industrial zones</h2>
      <p>
        M-1 and M-2 are light and heavy industrial. PDR stands for "production, distribution,
        repair" and includes things like warehouses and auto body shops. they're fine on the
        outskirts of the city, but it makes no sense to have vast warehouses and expanses of
        concrete right next to neighborhoods like SoMa and FiDi where a studio can easily cost
        $3,000 a month.
      </p>
