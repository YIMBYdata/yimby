      <h1>zoning map</h1>
      <p>
        in san francisco, what you can build and where depends on a complex system of zoning and
        height restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        our most beautiful and iconic buildings are often in violation of current zoning, meaning
        that they couldn't be built today.
      </p>
      <p>
        here's where we are today.
      </p>
      <h2>RH-1: the burbs</h2>
      <p>
        much of the residential land in our city is suburban-style development where you're only
        allowed to build a single unit per lot. RH-1(D) means those units have to be detached
        houses.
      </p>
      <h2>RH-2 and -3: low density residential</h2>
      <p>
        these zones are better than RH-1, but still pretty sparse, and still car centered.
      </p>
      <h2>RM: residential mixed</h2>
      <p>
        these zones allow housing, grocery stores, office space, and shops in the same neighborhood.
        that makes them friendlier for people who want to walk or bike.
      </p>
      <h2>NCT and NCD: "neighborhood commercial"</h2>
      <p>
        these are mixed districts that allow housing, shops, and transit. they vary in density, but
        some are pretty great.
      </p>
      <h2>C: commercial</h2>
      <p>
        this mostly means office towers, but also includes shopping malls. unfortunately in SF, most
        commercial development has no convenient transit. people are expected to drive.
      </p>
      <h2>M and PDR: industrial areas</h2>
      <p>
        M-1 and M-2 are light and heavy industrial. PDR stands for "production, distribution,
        repair" and includes things like warehouses and auto body shops. they're fine on the
        outskirts of the city, but it makes no sense to have vast warehouses and expanses of
        concrete right next to neighborhoods like SoMa and FiDi where a studio can easily cost
        $3,000 a month.
      </p>
      <h2>special zones</h2>
      <p>
        areas like Chinatown and South Park get their own, special zoning. the rules vary a lot,
        but for the most part these areas are great. unlike the undifferentiated, bedroom community
        garage-and-driveway vibe of RH-1, special zones are mostly mixed use and have a unique local
        character.
