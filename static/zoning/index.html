      <h1>sf zoning map</h1>
      <p>
        in san francisco, what you can build and where depends on a complex system of zoning and
        height restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        many of our beautiful neighborhoods and iconic buildings don't meet later
        zoning laws, meaning that they couldn't be built today.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>here's our current zoning.</strong>
        you can drag the map. hold shift to rotate.
        pinch or scroll to zoom. click for details.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h2>RH-1: the burbs</h2>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>RH-1(D)</span>
        <span>RH-1</span>
        <span>RH-1(S)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        much of the residential land in our city is suburban-style development where you're only
        allowed to build a single unit per lot. RH-1(D) means those units have to be detached
        houses.
      </p>
      <h2>RH-2 and -3: low density residential</h2>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>RH-2</span>
        <span>RH-3</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        these zones are better than RH-1, but still pretty sparse, and still car centered.
      </p>
      <h2>RM: residential mixed</h2>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>RM-1</span>
        <span>RM-2</span>
        <span>RM-3</span>
        <span>RM-4</span>
        <span>RC-3</span>
        <span>RC-4</span>
        <span>RCD</span>
        <span>RTO</span>
        <span>RTO-M</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        these zones allow housing, grocery stores, office space, and shops in the same neighborhood.
        that makes them friendlier for people who want to walk or bike.
      </p>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>MUO</span>
        <span>MUG</span>
        <span>MUR</span>
        <span>UMU</span>
        <span>WMUG</span>
        <span>WMUO</span>
        <span>SSO</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        soma / fidi has it's own zones, including three kinds of "mixed-use urban" and
        one kind of "urban mixed use". the bureaucracy has no chill.
      </p>

      <h2>RED: dense residential</h2>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>RED</span>
        <span>RED-MX</span>
        <span>RH DTR</span>
        <span>SB-DTR</span>
        <span>TB DTR</span>
      </p>
      soma has "residential enclaves", which are several-story apartment complexes.
      fidi has "downtown residential", which contains skyscrapers.
      <h2>NCT and NCD: "neighborhood commercial"</h2>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>NC-1</span>
        <span>NC-2</span>
        <span>NC-3</span>
        <span>NC-S</span>
        <span>NCD</span>
        <span>NCT</span>
        <span>NCT-1</span>
        <span>NCT-2</span>
        <span>NCT-3</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        these are street districts that allow housing, shops, and transit. they vary in density.
        some are pretty great.
      </p>
      <h2>C: commercial</h2>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>C-2</span>
        <span>C-3-G</span>
        <span>C-3-O</span>
        <span>C-3-O(SD)</span>
        <span>C-3-R</span>
        <span>C-3-S</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        this mostly means office towers, but also includes shopping malls. no housing.
      </p>
      <h2>M and PDR: industrial areas</h2>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>M-1</span>
        <span>M-2</span>
        <span>PDR-1-B</span>
        <span>PDR-1-D</span>
        <span>PDR-1-G</span>
        <span>PDR-2</span>
        <span>SALI</span>
        <span>SLI</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        M-1 and M-2 are light and heavy industrial. PDR stands for "production, distribution,
        repair" and includes things like warehouses and auto body shops. they're fine on the
        outskirts of the city, but it's hard to justify warehouses and expanses of
        concrete in neighborhoods like SoMa where a studio can easily cost
        $3,000 a month.
      </p>
      <h2>special zones</h2>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>CCB</span>
        <span>CRNC</span>
        <span>CVR</span>
      </p>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>MB-O</span>
        <span>MB-OS</span>
        <span>MB-RA</span>
        <span>HP-RA</span>
        <span>SPD</span>
      </p>
      <p class='legend'>
        <span>PM-OS</span>
        <span>PM-S</span>
        <span>PM-CF</span>
        <span>PM-MU1</span>
        <span>PM-MU2</span>
        <span>PM-R</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        some areas, like Chinatown and South Park, get their own special zoning. the rules vary,
        but for the most part these areas are great. unlike the bedroom community
        garage-and-driveway vibe of RH-1, special zones are mixed use and have a unique local
        character.
