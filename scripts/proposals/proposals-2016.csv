The gabled  home has been listed as a potential historic resource with the California Register and is a contributing  member of the distinctive Olsen's Queen Anne Cottages Historic District as designated  by the San Francisco Planning Department.The proposed  project consists of substantial improvements to convert some or all of the substandard areas to new legitimate habitable space. This entails a new foundation and slab with partial excavation and retaining to create good ceiling height (8'-0"") at ground level.The existing stairs are dimensionally  substandard per current codes and will be reconfigured  in the context of this project.   An open ""stacked""  switchback stair is the most efficient solution created with a new dormer window at the existing roof.The structure will undergo  a partial foundation replacement  with shear walls and connections to achieve a partial seismic upgrade.  The historical street facade limits a complete seismic upgrade  to this area of the building.A proposed  roof deck will be added to the back of the house on the roof of the existing kitchen/dining.Purpose of Meeting:A    Confirm proposed roof dormers comply with Preservation Planning requirements and satisfy Section 311 Notification Exemptions.  Previous side-by-side roof dormer configuration per Zoning Administration Bulletin No. 96.2 was not looked at favorably by PIC Preservation Planner and recommended current dormer layout with flipped dormer configuration.B.

We met with a planner at the PIC and he indicated that the garage change may qualify under Exception 144 (A) which would allow for a negotiation on widths of garage door and curb cut due to  specific site conditions  on upslope lots of greater of 20%. The subject  property meets the 20% slope. The current situation is a safety hazard (car tires slipping) and due to the divider on Liberty Street, it is very difficult  to get in and out of the garage spaces. Due to the safety concerns, the  clients  are hoping  to  have the  garage work  done prior  to  any other changes (that would require the EE review).b) We have engaged Left Coast Consulting to  prepare an HRE; will  have for the meeting.  We would like to get an initial read on Historic Resource Evaluation (HRE) report in preparation for an EE application.c)  Assuming non-historic upon EE, are there any limits to facade changes on the 1''.  2nd and 3'd floor allowed other than design guidelines.d)  Assuming non-historic  upon  EE, will  an expansion of the 3'd  floor  be allowed (currently  anoccupied attic). If yes, what setbacks, if any, would be required.1.1.2     Department of Public Works (DPW):a)  What public right of way changes will be required if double wide door is granted?b)  What  are  the  requirements  for  slope  adjustments  at  each side (lot  is  on  steep  slope);neighborhood pattern is planters.c)  The house is on the corner of Sanchez and Liberty Streets. Along Sanchez, there is a set of steps in the ROW paralleling the house; it appears that  some of the steps are damaged. What is process for having steps repaired?1.1.3     Department of Building Inspection (DBI) and San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD):a)  Assuming  non-historic  upon  EE   and  3'd   floor  expansion  is  allowed,  will  this  trigger  fire sprinklers? Type? Current  house is 2   stories above garage/basement. Proposed is 3  stories above garage/basement.b)  Assuming non-historic upon EE and 3'd floor expansion is allowed, will a second means of egress be required? We think  no as new floor would only be two stories above actual grade (at rearyard -which is where access is to the house).",,

This project will install a bike lane on westbound Bosworth in this area in the uphill direction, giving a dedicated zone to cyclists and minimizing conflicts with passing vehicles. The main goal of this project is to address community concerns surrounding safety for people biking uphill on Bosworth Street towards the Diamond Heights and Midtown Terrace neighborhoods. This project proposes two design alternatives that will both provide a bike lane on westbound Bosworth Street between Hamerton Avenue and the O’Shaughnessy Boulevard shared bicycle/pedestrian path. When vehicles and cyclists are sharing a roadway in the uphill direction, there can be conflicts caused by fast moving vehicles needing to pass slow moving cyclists. By installing a separate zone and comfortable uphill bike lane for cyclists, vehicle/bicycle passing and therefore potential conflicts are minimized.

"11/22/2016","2016-015072ETM","Environmental Time and Materials (ETM)","SFMTA - Bosworth Street Uphill Bike Lane","Closed - CEQA Clearance Issued","The SFMTA proposes to make safety improvements for people bicycling on westbound Bosworth Street between Hamerton Avenue and the O’Shaughnessy Boulevard shared bicycle/pedestrian path. This project will install a bike lane on westbound Bosworth in this area in the uphill direction, giving a dedicated zone to cyclists and minimizing conflicts with passing vehicles. The main goal of this project is to address community concerns surrounding safety for people biking uphill on Bosworth Street towards the Diamond Heights and Midtown Terrace neighborhoods. This project proposes two design alternatives that will both provide a bike lane on westbound Bosworth Street between Hamerton Avenue and the O’Shaughnessy Boulevard shared bicycle/pedestrian path. When vehicles and cyclists are sharing a roadway in the uphill direction, there can be conflicts caused by fast moving vehicles needing to pass slow moving cyclists. By installing a separate zone and comfortable uphill bike lane for cyclists, vehicle/bicycle passing and therefore potential conflicts are minimized. This is a paint‐only project that includes the following elements: Uphill Bike Lane: Both design alternatives (Option A and B) install an uphill bike lane on westbound Bosworth Street between Hamerton Avenue and the O’Shaughnessy Boulevard sharedbicycle/pedestrian path. Parking Removal: To provide sufficient space for the uphill bike lane in both options, someunmetered parking will need to be removed on westbound Bosworth Street between Hamerton Avenue and Elk Street.",,

In addition, a portion of the one-story wing of the existing WSS Main Building would be modified (increased in height by about 5 feet) to accommodate a new, vertical redundant wet-weather bar screen and conveyor system and a new sluice gate operator. The Project would also include construction of a new redundant sewage/stormwater conveyance channel beneath the WSS Main Building’s existing one-story restroom and control room wing. The redundant channel would connect underground to the pumps inside the WSS, to the existing Westside Transport/Storage (WST) Box, and to the forcemain to the Oceanside Plant via 300-feet of new 54-inch forcemain and a new vault at the east side of the Great Highway just south of the WSS south driveway. These modifications would entail open-cut excavations to a depth of up to 65-feet under the sidewalk and part of the northbound curb lane of the Great Highway, adjacent to the WSS. The Project would also include replacement of main wet-weather submersible pumps that are located in the west wet-well south of the Main Building and expansion of the pump room in the Main Building to accommodate enlarged submersible pumps with that would provide redundant/stand-by pump capacity.

The redundant channel would connect underground to the pumps inside the WSS, to the existing Westside Transport/Storage (WST) Box, and to the forcemain to the Oceanside Plant via 300-feet of new 54-inch forcemain and a new vault at the east side of the Great Highway just south of the WSS south driveway. These modifications would entail open-cut excavations to a depth of up to 65-feet under the sidewalk and part of the northbound curb lane of the Great Highway, adjacent to the WSS. The Project would also include replacement of main wet-weather submersible pumps that are located in the west wet-well south of the Main Building and expansion of the pump room in the Main Building to accommodate enlarged submersible pumps with that would provide redundant/stand-by pump capacity. Other internal improvements to the pump station would include relocation of the restroom, replacement of interior pipe manifolds and other mechanical/electrical equipment, and removal of 480-v low-voltage electrical equipment, which would be replaced by new 4,160-v medium-voltage electrical equipment in the proposed new electrical building. In addition, PG&E would provide new buried electrical feeds to the new electrical building from Skyline Blvd. and along Sloat Blvd. to the WSS.",,

As an active transit corridor for vehicles in revenue service and vehicles traveling to and from the Potrero Division, bicycle lanes will provide the benefit of increased separation between bicyclists and large vehicles.The typical proposed roadway configuration is 9’ curbside on-street parking, 5’ bike lanes, and one 11’ travel lane in each direction. The typical existing roadway configuration is one 25’ travel lane in each direction with curbside on-street parking. Zero on-street parking will be removed for the purpose of installing the bicycle lanes. This project will increase theamount of bicycle lanes on San Francisco streets by 0.6 mile. The proposed bike lanes were not evaluated in the San Francisco Bicycle Plan Environmental Impact Report.In addition to bicycling improvements, this project will also install intersection daylighting to improve pedestrian safety through improved visibility. Intersection daylighting will be installed at the following locations:• Southbound Bryant Street north of 17th Street (Removes 1 on-street parking space)• Southbound Bryant north of 16th Street (Removes 1 on-street parking space)• Westbound 16th Street west of Bryant Street (Removes 1 on-street parking space)• Northbound Bryant Street north of 15th Street (Removes 1 on-street parking space)The extents of this project are part of an active Muni transit route, 27-Bryant.

The intent of the proposed bond amendment is to expand the existing eligible uses for the unexpended market rate tranche to include acquisition, improvement, and rehabilitation of “at-risk” multi-unit residential properties. In addition, it would allow non-profit affordable housing developers to convert those properties to permanently-affordable housing through the City’s Small Site Acquisition & Rehabilitation Program or other means.

Upon installation of the piers, a four-foot thick matt slab would be poured to strengthen the foundation of the building. To limit the extent of the slab, piers could also be drilled inside tanks 1 and 7. The slab would be below grade and once completed, the areas surrounding the building would either be restored to their general pre-project condition or would support uses related to the surrounding buildings (e.g., utilities which would be installed above the slab and piers).Repairs to spalling concrete and corroding re-bar (involving the removal of corrosion and the sealing of the re-bar) would be made to underground structural elements under Building 240 (Secondary Bypass Junction Structure) and Building 525 (Primary Effluent Channel and Disinfection Facility).None of the proposed repairs would increase the treatment capacity of the SEWPCP, nor would they enlarge the building envelope of any of the buildings or expand the footprint of any of the buildings.

Arrowhead Reservoir is located in the eastern portion of Sharp Park and is approximately 33,000 square feet with an estimated capacity of 7.5 million gallons of water. The reservoir is suspected of containing introduced invasive bass, which pose a potential predator threat to CRLF populations. Accordingly, Conservation Measures 27 and 28 of the 2012 Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinion for the Sharp Park Pumphouse Project (Document No.: 08ESMF00-2012-F-0082-2)), as well as Measure 1a of the 2016 Sharp Park Invasive Species Management Plan, call for draining Arrowhead Reservoir to eliminate potential predators and to restore and enhance potential CRLF habitat. Draining Lake Arrowhead would take place during 2 to 5 consecutive days in summer/fall 2016, and will be done slowly and in stages in order to allow for careful biological monitoring to prevent stranding and other harm to all life stages of CRLF or SFGS. Biological monitoring will be conducted by Fish and Wildlife Service-approved SFRPD Natural Areas Staff and/or outside biological consultants. Draining will be accomplished by opening an existing 10-inch water main valve, which will drain the contents of Arrowhead Reservoir into the adjacent remediated rifle range. A crank is used to open the valve at the drainage box, and then the water exits the pipe near the remediated rifle range. The water will drain downhill across the range. The water will be drained at a slow rate so no erosion or gullying is expected. (Refer to project attachments). RPD staff believes that all the water will be absorbed into the ground before it hits the road. Arrowhead Lake will be refilled naturally by rainwater during the 2016-2017 rainy season. Beyond SFRPD staff and/or consultant staff time, no further resources are anticipated in order to implement the Project.",,

"05/06/2016","2016-005919ETM","Environmental Time and Materials (ETM)","RPD -  Arrowhead Reservoir at Sharp Park","Closed - CEQA Clearance Issued","Sharp Park, a San Francisco Recreation and Park Department (SFRPD) facility located in Pacifica, CA, serves as habitat for the federally-threatened California red-legged frog (CRLF) and the federally-endangered San Francisco garter snake (SFGS). Arrowhead Reservoir is located in the eastern portion of Sharp Park and is approximately 33,000 square feet with an estimated capacity of 7.5 million gallons of water. The reservoir is suspected of containing introduced invasive bass, which pose a potential predator threat to CRLF populations. Accordingly, Conservation Measures 27 and 28 of the 2012 Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinion for the Sharp Park Pumphouse Project (Document No.: 08ESMF00-2012-F-0082-2)), as well as Measure 1a of the 2016 Sharp Park Invasive Species Management Plan, call for draining Arrowhead Reservoir to eliminate potential predators and to restore and enhance potential CRLF habitat. Draining Lake Arrowhead would take place during 2 to 5 consecutive days in summer/fall 2016, and will be done slowly and in stages in order to allow for careful biological monitoring to prevent stranding and other harm to all life stages of CRLF or SFGS. Biological monitoring will be conducted by Fish and Wildlife Service-approved SFRPD Natural Areas Staff and/or outside biological consultants. Draining will be accomplished by opening an existing 10-inch water main valve, which will drain the contents of Arrowhead Reservoir into the adjacent remediated rifle range. A crank is used to open the valve at the drainage box, and then the water exits the pipe near the remediated rifle range. The water will drain downhill across the range. The water will be drained at a slow rate so no erosion or gullying is expected. (Refer to project attachments). RPD staff believes that all the water will be absorbed into the ground before it hits the road. Arrowhead Lake will be refilled naturally by rainwater during the 2016-2017 rainy season. Beyond SFRPD staff and/or consultant staff time, no further resources are anticipated in order to implement the Project.",,

The top floor is occupied by the master bedroom suite, and exterior terrace.  The next level down is the main living, kitchen, dining area, which accesses directly from the street.  The next level down contains private bedrooms and common area.  The lowest level contains a guest bedroom suite and storage space.  The massing of the project has been sensitively adjusted to minimize the structure's height, maximize neighbor's view corridors, minimize the structure's blocking of natural light to the neighbor's properties, and sensitively placing decks and windows to avoid direct views into neighbor's private windows.  The purpose of the meeting is to determine if the garage is more appropriately placed on the site as shown in the attached plans or as a free-standing garage located along the Penny Lane Alley.  Also, whether the site massing as shown adequately addresses the view corridors, natural light and air access and privacy issues of the neighboring properties as well as any other potential planning or zoning conflicts.",,

The project also involves the development of 120 onsite parking spaces for employees' personal vehicles and 49 spaces for trucks and operations equipment, as well as a vactor waste station for the collection and separation of rain water & debris collected from the City's catch basins, a tent-like maintenance bay, and a below-grade confined-space training area.",,

"01/28/2016","2016-001289PRV","Project Review Meetings (PRV)","88 Broadway","Closed - Informational","88 Broadway (0140/007, 008); Interdepartmental Project Review to discuss the following:  Chinatown Community Development Center (Chinatown CDC) has begun rehabilitation of 990 Pacific Avenue, San Francisco, as part of Mayor Lee’s citywide initiative to re‐envision San Francisco’s public housing stock through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Program. 990 Pacific is a seven‐story, 92‐unit concrete building serving elderly and disabled residents. This property is at risk of major damage in a large earthquake and requires a significant seismic retrofit, including installation of full‐height shear walls, which the Planning Department reviewed as part of the project’s permitting process. The seismic retrofit work and repairs to other major building systems (electrical upgrade, plumbing repair, heating system replacement, hazardous materials abatement, etc.) require Chinatown CDC to temporarily relocate all of the building’s residents off‐site for up to 12 months, starting around June 2016.The residential population of 990 Pacific is very fragile: 45% of residents are over age 80, and 75% speak Cantonese as their primary language. Due to their age and language capacity, residents of 990 Pacific are heavily dependent on the social services, health care providers, and shopping and recreational opportunities in San Francisco’s Chinatown. Chinatown CDC has been working closely with the San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) to identify off‐site relocation units for 990 Pacific residents as close to Chinatown as possible. This is very challenging, given the dearth of available units, particularly those with elevators, in and around Chinatown. In light of these challenges, Chinatown CDC and MOHCD are now working to place temporary relocation housing on Assessor’s Block/Lot 0140/007 and 0140/008. These sites are currently public parking lots owned by the Port of San Francisco and the San Francisco Department of Public Works, respectively, but are scheduled to become new multifamily affordable housing projects, via the Request for Proposals that MOHCD recently released for 88 Broadway.The purpose of the requested Project Review Meeting is to determine City approval requirements for locating 30‐40 destination trailers on the site to serve as temporary relocation units for 990 Pacific residents. Chinatown CDC is releasing a Request for Proposals for trailers that meet the project’s aesthetic and functional requirements, but a general example of the type of product is available at this link:  http://www.forestriverinc.com/product‐details.aspx?LineID=191&Image=5101. The proposed project would also include a modular management office, community room, and laundry facilities, as well as landscaping and security measures. After the seismic retrofit of 990 Pacific is complete, the residents would return to the building and the trailers would be removed. The site would then be developed into new multifamily housing, per the terms of the 88 Broadway RFP.Chinatown CDC appreciates that this project will require close collaboration with the Planning Department, the Department of Public Works, and the Department of Building Inspection on an accelerated timeline. The possibility of accommodating up to half of the residents of 990 Pacific at a central location within blocks of Chinatown compels us to make every effort to determine conditions under which this project can succeed.",,

I can still sign off on the plans because the DR was already heard and approved as is. therefore, there is no reason to hold up the plans. I reviewed the demo calcs manually to verify there is tantamount to demolition taking place. Two out of the four threshold are met, but because of the ""and"" clause in Section 317, this does not determine to be a tantamount to demolition based on these findings. The roof and second floor will be completely removed to 100% and the rear linear façade will be removed to 50%. The second floor will be however, lifted up slightly in the same general area and shape. The floor plate has only small changes based on the section drawings and floor plan. After speaking with the sponsors, that change is not necessarily a demolition, but a alteration. The sponsors have been informed of these findings. Therefore, there is no further review needed and all is complete.  Followed up with sponsor about demo calc findings and suggested they review the site to detect if there are any issues like dry rot that have not been discovered.
