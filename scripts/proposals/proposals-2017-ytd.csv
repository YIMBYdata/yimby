These bike lane upgrades will establish safer connections from the Octavia Boulevard bike route and the Sanchez Street bike route to bike lanes on Market Street. The goal of the Sanchez Street changes is to better connect the bike route on Sanchez Street with the bike lanes on Market Street. To do so, the SFMTA proposes green bike boxes on Sanchez Street in the north and southbound directions to allow people biking a place to wait while turning left onto Market Street on continuing straight onto Sanchez Street. The SFMTA does not build bike boxes unless there is a bike lane on the street. Lead-in bike lanes allow for bikes to have a safe and clear path of travel around stopped vehicles and into the bike box. The SFMTA proposes short, lead-in bike lanes on north- and southbound Sanchez Street to provide a safe path of travel into these planned bike boxes.The goal of the Octavia Boulevard changes is to solve a long-standing area of conflict between bikes and vehicles at the intersection of Octavia/Market. The current configuration forces people biking south on the Octavia frontage road to travel adjacent to motor vehicle traffic in order to cross Market Street. This traffic is often moving at high speeds as drivers prepare to enter the US-101 freeway. The SFMTA proposes to remove the Class I bike path and short segment of Class II southbound bike lanes at this location and instead paint Class II bike lanes on the southbound Octavia Boulevard frontage road from Waller Street to Market Street. The Class I bike path will be filled in with concrete and the Class II bike lane space adjacent to Octavia Boulevard will be filled with a concrete curb extension.",,

Inspection and repair of the valves requires the SFPUC to lower the reservoir to access, isolate, and repair the valves. The SFPUC would lower the reservoir in a controlled manner to below the Intake Tower to an elevation that would allow the SFPUC to safely inspect and repair or replace the valves. This could entail lowering the water level to a nearly fully drained elevation. The SFPUC will maintain some water in the reservoir for aquatic refuge and to maintain some downstream flow to Cherry Creek. The full extent of valve damage is unknown.

The proposed addition will be located at the rear of the existing building facing Hyde and McAllister streets. There will be 13,000 s.f. of usable rooftop area plus a new elevator tower and a new elevator machine room. The existing loading ramp will be widened and the existing curb cut will be altered to safely accommodate large semi-trucks backing into the loading dock. Alteration of the loading dock ramp will require removal of one existing street tree.  The new addition will accommodate a new special exhibition gallery, lobby, lounge, and restrooms, while the rooftop will include a mechanical room, storage room, escalator vestibule, pantry and roof gallery.  Renovation of the interior of the historic building will include new desks, furnishings, painting and audio-visual in the main lobby and north and south courts; renovation of the classrooms and coat check; and signage and graphics throughout the public spaces, including code-related signage throughout the building as required. The existing check-in desk in the main lobby will be removed and direct access to the Grand Stair reestablished.Purpose of the Meeting:The Interdepartmental meeting is required because the project is located within a Seismic Hazard Zone. The project team has previously met with the San Francisco Planning Department and has had pre-application meetings with the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection and the San Francisco Fire Department. To date, the project team has not met with the San Francisco Department of Public Works.",,

Various components of the existing electric security system need to be replaced due to aging, lightning damage, and necessary technological upgrades to comply with electrical codes. The Project consists of upgrading the existing Lenel security system; removing and/or replacing outdated or non-functional infrared/motion sensors, sounders, and door contacts; installing additional indoor/outdoor cameras, including two exterior cameras on the dam; and repairing or replacing the existing intrusion system. The Project would also involve installation of cable pathways where they are not currently present, as well as installation of all supporting structures, including core drilling, building penetrations, structural work, conduit, back boxes, pull strings, cable tray and supporting hardware. Once installed the system will include access controlled doors with proximity card readers with pin pads, door contacts, door handles with integrated fingerprint readers, and motion detectors. The proposed Project would involve addition or modification of small equipment on existing structures. No excavation or ground disturbance would be required.",,
